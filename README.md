# Bitcoin Baron 


## Information

- This is just another project I worked on during early 2019 when I was learning about Node.JS. Since then I have learn't a lot more and would do a lot of things differently in terms of how this project is structured and built.

## Features

- Listens to messages as a bot, responds to certain cryptocurrency commands and uses public API's to check the prices of cryptocurrencies and notifies the user of them

- Users can use the built in notification/reminder system via commands which notifies a user when a cryptocurrency price has gone above or below what they want checked

- Supports connections to IRCs via SSL
